2. Write a program to find the greatest common divisor of two integers by Prime factorization and Euclidean algorithm.
3. Write a program that will calculate lowest common multiple of two integers by factorization.
4. Implement insertion sort that will sort n integers in increasing order.
5. Write a program that calculates the square root of an integer.
6. Write a program that calculates the square root of a number with Newton's method of tangents within the given epsilon error.
7. Given nxn matrix, where n is a positive integer, write a program that will clockwise rotate the matrix 90 degrees.
    7.1 Write the non-in-place version using O(nxn) space.
    7.2 Write the in-place version using O(1) space.
8. Given a string of words separated by spaces. Write a O(n) program to reverse the string.
9. Write variadic function that takes a string and a bunch of numbers, and replaces each "#" symbol with corresponding number.
